				<h3>Heart Disease Prediction and Classification</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
					<li>Created <b>14 Classification models</b> and trained them on a global dataset of patients with heart disease</li>
					<li>Models perform with accuracy that <b>matches leading models</b> and sensitivity that <b>outperforms</b> leading models and research
						<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
							<li>Random Forest KPCA with Bagging achieved <b>94%</b> sensitivity and <b>85%</b> accuracy</li>
							<li>Linear SVC model with accuracy and sensitivity of <b>87%</b></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Highlighted the need for more research into data from varying medical centers that collect information that has not been previously used in heart disease research</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Face Mask Detection and Recogntion in Multi-Face Images</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
					<li>Created an Image Processing model based on VGGNet, a <b>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</b>, to classify faces based on the presence of face masks</li>
					<li>Used modified Haar Cascade logic to find faces in real world images</li>
					<li>Validation <b>accuracy of 99.15%</b> on input images of faces</li>
					<li>Locates and classifies real-world faces in a usable interface</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>FIFA Player Analysis</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
					<li>We used Principal Component Analysis to categorize all player statistics into the fice components of Attacking, Defending, Hype & Value, Players Physique, and Others</li>
					<li>Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed that player reputation and compensation are not linearly related</li>
					<li>Canonical Correspondence Analysis confirmed that player's skills and attributes are strongly correlated to their position</li>
